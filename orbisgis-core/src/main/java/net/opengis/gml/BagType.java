/**
 * A non-abstract generic collection type that can be used as a document element for a collection of any GML types - Geometries, Topologies, Features ...
 * 
 * FeatureCollections may only contain Features.  GeometryCollections may only contain Geometrys.  Bags are less constrained  they must contain objects that are substitutable for gml:_Object.  This may mix several levels, including Features, Definitions, Dictionaries, Geometries etc.  
 * 
 * The content model would ideally be 
 *    member 0..*
 *    members 0..1
 *    member 0..*
 * for maximum flexibility in building a collection from both homogeneous and distinct components: 
 * included "member" elements each contain a single Object
 * an included "members" element contains a set of Objects 
 * 
 * However, this is non-deterministic, thus prohibited by XSD.
 * 
 * <p>Java class for BagType complex type.
 * 
 * <p>The following schema fragment specifies the expected content contained within this class.
